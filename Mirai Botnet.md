### Milestones

1. What is Mirai Botnet?

```
"Mirai" is self-propagating malware (Malicious Software) that infects devices that run on ARC processors (Like cameras, mobile) and turning them into a network of remotely controlled bots.This network of bots is called a "botnet".
```

2. Who created the Mirai Botnet?
``` 
A group of 20 year old Paras Jha, Josiah White and Dalton Norman.
Paras Jha and Josiah White were co-founders of The Protraf Solutions company that offered DDoS mitigation services to the victims of the Mirai botnet attacks.This trio became interested in how DDoS attacks could be used for profit.
```
3. What was the purpose of Mirai Botnet?
```
Mirai Botnet was initially designed to DDoS Minecraft servers and companies offering DDoS protection to servers. Para Jha was a huge Minecraft fan, and that by hosting Minecraft game servers big money can be made which lead to launch DDoS attacks against their rival servers to kock them out of the competion. He was a Huge anime fan and posted Mirai code under name "Anna-Senpai" and named it "Mirai".
In 19 September 2016, Mirai was used against the French host OVH who hosted a popular tool that Minecraft server hosts use to fight against DDoS attacks.After few days Jha posted the Mirai code online and thus others manipulated the code. In 12 October 2016 another attack was launched by unknown people against Dyn infrastructure company who offers DNS to many big websites.

4. What is DDoS mitigation?
``` 
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic.

5. Who are vulnerable to Mirai Botnet?

<br>
```
The botnet searches for devices that have weak factory default or hard-coded user names and passwords, all of which are particularly vulnerable to attack. Once the devices have been infected and turned into bots, they can be directed to attack a single server to disable its functioning.

6. How to prevent DDos attack?
```
By

•  Examine how the company obtains its DNS services.
•  Check routers for unauthorized DNS changes.
•  Change factory default passwords on all network equipment.
•  Get network forensics in order.
•  Consider a CDN provider to handle peak traffic loads.
```
